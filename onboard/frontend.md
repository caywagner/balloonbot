# Frontend introductory materials

## Javascript

Skim lectures 7-9 (js and asynshronous programming) on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14WXPCo7AtJW7YdWtMhi76lBiVXvS_yFf)

(optional) [Mozilla javascript guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

## Slack API

Read (no installs) the following [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/#read_the_docs) documentation

- [Events API](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/events-api)
- [List of events](https://api.slack.com/events)

## Moving Forward

From here you should have a basic understanding of javascript and be able to bind Slack events to functions in our balloonbot code. Think about features you want to implement and what type of slack events and corresponding functions are needed to get those to function correctly. 

### Goals

- implement feature to link datasheets when components are mentioned
- outline and implement feature to send memes
