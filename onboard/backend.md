# Backend introductory materials

## Web communications

Skim lectures 0, 1, and 6 (web basics and REST APIs) on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14WXPCo7AtJW7YdWtMhi76lBiVXvS_yFf)

Read the [MDN Overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) and familiarize yourself with [HTTP request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) (`GET` and `POST` are most important)

Familiarize yourself with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/product)

Depending on how indepth we get, we might use [python](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm). Take a look if you're unfamiliar but may not be required.

## Hosting

We haven't defined what hosting solution we're using yet. Some options are [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/?nc2=h_ql_le_int_cc) or making our own [Apache](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-apache) or [NGINX](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-nginx) web server.

## Moving Forward

We need to decide on and implement a hosting solution.
